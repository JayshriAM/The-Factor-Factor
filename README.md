# The-Factor-Factor

Problem Statement
Adarsh is learning to factorise at school but he is finding it difficult to factorise a number and he takes a lot of time to do the same and needs practice. You being his best friend decided to help Adarsh by making an android application that takes a number and asks for its factor. Your first task is to make this app for Adarsh.

Normal Mode
Make an Android App where Adarsh can enter a number.
The app must then generate 3 options randomly. The numbers should be such that exactly one of the options is a factor of the entered number.
On selection of an option, it should show if answer is right or wrong and if wrong show the correct answer.
Hacker Mode
Adarsh is using the app and is improving but he is getting bored of the app so you want to make the app more interesting.

Implement a scoring system.
Record his longest winning streak. The count must remain intact even if app is restarted.
Implement the app in different layout for both portrait and landscape mode optimised for usage in the orientation.
Change app background color to green for every right answer and red for every wrong answer.
Hacker Mode++
Implement a countdowntimer(say 10 seconds) for every question. If time ends, end the current game and display result.
Make phone vibrate for every wrong answer.
